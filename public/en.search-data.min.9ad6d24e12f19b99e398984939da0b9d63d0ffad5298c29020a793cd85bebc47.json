[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/windows-ad/","title":"Windows Server AD on Proxmox","section":"Docs","content":"Setting up Windows Server AD on Proxmox#\rDeploying Windows Server on Proxmox VE requires specific configuration to run efficiently. Windows does not natively support the Linux KVM virtualization architecture; therefore, VirtIO drivers must be injected during installation to ensure proper storage and network performance.\nWhy VirtIO? Without VirtIO drivers, Windows must use emulated IDE/SATA storage and Intel E1000 networking, which results in significant performance degradation. VirtIO allows the guest OS to \u0026ldquo;speak\u0026rdquo; directly to the hypervisor.\nPhase A: The Downloads#\rBefore beginning the VM creation, ensure the following ISO files are uploaded to your Proxmox storage (local \u0026gt; ISO Images \u0026gt; Upload).\nWindows Server 2022 Evaluation Source: Microsoft Evaluation Center Edition: 64-bit ISO. VirtIO Driver ISO Source: Fedora People (Stable) Contents: Required paravirtualized storage and network drivers. Phase B: Virtual Machine Configuration#\rUse the following specifications to balance performance with resource conservation.\n1. General \u0026amp; OS#\rName: DC01 (Standard naming convention). Type: Microsoft Windows. Version: 11/2022. 2. System#\rGraphics Card: Default or SPICE (SPICE offers smoother console performance). Qemu Agent: Checked (Crucial for IP reporting and graceful shutdowns). 3. Disks (Storage)#\rBus/Device: SCSI (Best performance). Storage: local-lvm (or preferred storage). Disk Size: 60 GB (Min: 30GB for OS; 60GB allows for logs/updates). Cache: Write back (Safe for labs; improves speed). Discard: Checked (TRIM support to save SSD space). 4. CPU \u0026amp; Memory#\rCores: 2 (DC tasks are generally low-load). Type: Host (Passes through host CPU features). Memory: Minimum: 2048 MB Recommended: 4096 MB (Server Core) or 6144 MB (Desktop Experience). 5. Network#\rModel: VirtIO (Paravirtualized). Warning: Do not use Intel E1000; VirtIO supports 10Gbps link speeds. Phase C: The \u0026ldquo;Two-CD\u0026rdquo; Trick#\rTo install the OS on a SCSI drive, the installer requires access to the drivers simultaneously.\nNavigate to VM \u0026gt; Hardware. Verify the Windows ISO is attached to the primary CD drive. Click Add \u0026gt; CD/DVD Drive. Select the virtio-win.iso. Result: You must have two CD drives attached before booting: one containing the OS installer, and one containing the drivers.\nPhase D: Installation \u0026amp; Driver Loading#\rStart the VM and open the Console. Select Windows Server 2022 Standard Desktop Experience. Proceed to the screen: \u0026ldquo;Where do you want to install Windows?\u0026rdquo; Note: The list will be empty because Windows cannot see the SCSI drive yet. Click Load Driver \u0026gt; Browse. Navigate to the storage driver: CD Drive (VirtIO) \u0026gt; vioscsi \u0026gt; 2k22 \u0026gt; amd64 Click OK/Next. The 60GB drive will appear. Pro Tip: You can repeat the \u0026ldquo;Load Driver\u0026rdquo; step now for the network driver to ensure connectivity immediately after boot. Navigate to: NetKVM \u0026gt; 2k22 \u0026gt; amd64\nPhase E: Post-Install Configuration#\r1. Guest Tools#\rOnce logged into Windows:\nOpen File Explorer. Open the VirtIO CD drive. Run virtio-win-guest-tools.exe. Result: This installs the QEMU agent and fixes screen resolution and mouse latency. 2. Promote to Domain Controller#\rOpen Server Manager. Go to Manage \u0026gt; Add Roles and Features \u0026gt; Active Directory Domain Services. Complete the installation. Click the Yellow Flag notification icon in the top right. Select Promote this server to a domain controller. Select Add a new forest (e.g., homelab.local or ad.yourname.com).

Architecture Overview#\rThis project utilizes a Serverless Static Website architecture designed for high availability, security, and zero-maintenance scaling. The cost is negligible (Free Tier eligible) while offering enterprise-grade performance.\nDNS: Cloudflare (Manages DNS records and SSL Strict Mode). CDN: AWS CloudFront (Global caching, SSL termination, and Edge Logic). Storage: AWS S3 (Private bucket, accessible only via CloudFront Origin Access Control). Generator: Hugo + Book Theme (Lightweight, no NPM dependencies). 2. Local Development Environment#\rTo manage this site locally, the following software stack is required.\nSoftware Version Purpose Hugo Standard or Extended Generates the static HTML site. AWS CLI v2.x Synchronizes local build files to the S3 bucket. Git Latest Version control and Theme Submodule management.

CloudFront (CDN)#\rOrigin: Pointed to S3 Bucket. Origin Access: set to Origin Access Control (OAC) to secure the bucket. Viewer Protocol: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS. Alternate Domain Name: [DOMAIN]. Custom SSL: Attached the ACM Certificate created above. Default Root Object: Set to index.html. D. Edge Logic (The Sub-Directory Fix)#\rTo prevent S3 \u0026ldquo;Access Denied\u0026rdquo; XML errors when visiting sub-pages (e.g., /docs/), a CloudFront Function was implemented on the Viewer Request behavior.\nFunction Name: append-index-html Code:\nfunction handler(event) { var request = event.request; var uri = request.uri; // If the URL ends with a slash \u0026#39;/\u0026#39;, add \u0026#39;index.html\u0026#39; to the end if (uri.endsWith(\u0026#39;/\u0026#39;)) { request.uri += \u0026#39;index.html\u0026#39;; } // If the URL doesn\u0026#39;t have a file extension, add \u0026#39;/index.html\u0026#39; else if (!uri.includes(\u0026#39;.\u0026#39;)) { request.uri += \u0026#39;/index.html\u0026#39;; } return request; } "},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/cheatsheet/","title":"Commands: Cheatsheet","section":"Docs","content":"Hugo \u0026amp; AWS Cloud Portfolio Cheatsheet#\rThis reference guide contains the essential commands for managing some of the projects.\nNote: I used placeholders to remove sensitive information from commands or file names.\n1.
